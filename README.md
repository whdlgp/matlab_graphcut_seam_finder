# matlab_graphcut_seam_finder
Slow, Made for practice. Assuming that warping already done, find the seam between the images of overlapping regions.

## Find seam between two image's overlapping region

### Example
#### First image
![](./im1.jpg)

#### Second image
![](./im2.jpg)

#### Find seam, draw mask
with weight bias zero  
![](./seam_mask_sample.jpg)  
with weight bias 1  
![](./seam_mask_sample2.jpg)  

#### Merge, draw seam on merged image
with weight bias zero  
![](./result_sample.jpg)  
![](./seam_draw_sample.jpg)  

with weight bias 1  
![](./result_sample2.jpg)
